NOFAC_hyperP_composite is the hyperparameter tuning for the model to predict the composite SSI outcome (organ space OR deep)
NOFAC_hyperP_deep is the hyperparameter tuning for the model to predict deep SSI alone
NOFAC_hyperP_organspace is the hyperparameter tuning for the model to predict organ space SSI alone

Models in this folder are facility-agnostic and therefore do not incorporate any facility-level data
