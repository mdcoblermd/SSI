FAC_hyperP_composite is the hyperparameter tuning for the model to predict the composite SSI outcome (organ space OR deep)
FAC_hyperP_deep is the hyperparameter tuning for the model to predict deep SSI alone
FAC_hyperP_organspace is the hyperparameter tuning for the model to predict organ space SSI alone

Models in this folder all incorporate facility-level data
