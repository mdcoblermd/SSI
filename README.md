We have 16 published Jupyter notebooks.

8 represent the code used to optimize hyperparmeters for our 8 models (maximum performance admission, maximum performance 48 hours, maximum performance 96 hours, maximum performance full LOS, and the same 4 timepoints for the facility agnostic models). The other 8 contain the code used to generate and evaluate the models after hyperparmeter tuning.
