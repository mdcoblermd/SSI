# SSI
We have 12 published Jupyter notebooks.

6 represent the code used to optimize hyperparmeters for our 6 models (maximum performance composite SSI, maximum performance deep SSI alone, maximum performance organ space SSI alone, and the same 3 SSI outcomes for the facility agnostic models). The other 6 contain the code used to generate and evaluate the models after hyperparmeter tuning.
